MeggyJrRGB
==========

Software for the Meggy Jr RGB kit from Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories.

Meggy Jr RGB is a platform to develop handheld pixel games based around an 8x8 RGB LED matrix display.  The heart of the system is an ATmega328P microcontroller,which can be programmed through the Arduino development environment.

Meggy Jr RGB is an open source project designed and released by Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories.

We also have a (rather underused) [http://groups.google.com/group/meggydev developer's mailing list] for Meggy Jr RGB; if you have questions, that might be a good place too.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


The library is currently at version 1.5.  All users are recommended to upgrade to the current version.  It is available for download from our newer github repository: https://github.com/evil-mad/MeggyJrRGB/releases/tag/v1.5


Version 1.5 contains fixes to adapt to internal changes to the Arduino environment, and for different brightness grades of LED matrix color elements.

Library 1.4 features a new game example, Revenge of the Cherry Tomatoes, which is a sequel to Attack of the Cherry Tomatoes (the default game).  (This game requires the larger memory available on the ATmega328P.)

Library 1.3x featured several new example programs, including a scrolling message "readerboard" program, an updated version of the game _Froggy Jr_, and three example programs demonstrating serial communication between Meggy Jr and a host computer-- one of which is a binary clock.

(If you are upgrading from an older version (pre 1.3) and have already written code for Meggy Jr, please see note "Changes.txt" included with the current download.)
